    <h1>Hiking</h1>
    <h2>The Only Valid Hobby</h2>

    <p>Hiking is a long, vigorous walk, usually on trails or footpaths in the countryside. Walking for pleasure developed in Europe during the eighteenth century.[1] Religious pilgrimages have existed much longer but they involve walking long distances for a spiritual purpose associated with specific religions.</p>
